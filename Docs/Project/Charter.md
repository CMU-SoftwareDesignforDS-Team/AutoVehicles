# Project Charter

## Business background

* Who is the client, what business domain the client is in.
	* The client is an autonomous vehicle (AV) manufacturing company, such as GM, Ford, or Tesla. The client is in both the automobile and high-tech industry.
* What business problems are we trying to address?
	* The client is rolling out an autonomous taxi service test in the Pittsburgh area. The client would like to do directed marketing. Instead of sending invitations and promotion codes to random people, they would like to target people who are more interested, and feel comfortable using the AV taxi first, to increase the autonomous taxi app’s usage rate in 4 weeks after the promotion. This will help to increase market share, company image, and data collection for technology improvements. The team will build an application to identify people who may show more interest in using autonomous taxi service, based on some of the online survey results.

## Scope
* What data science solutions are we trying to build?
	* We are trying to identify customer characteristics using the data from the study that affect the success of direct marketing using an AV taxi ride app. We are using correlation analysis and clustering method to identify people who may have more interest using the app. 
* What will we do?
	* We will run a promotion for free AV taxi rides and promote to interested users based on data from the study
* How is it going to be consumed by the customer?
	* Free AV taxi rides will be promoted through email and social media

## Metrics
* What are the qualitative objectives? (e.g. reduce user churn)
	* We want to target road users who are interested in taking an AV Taxi Ride using data based on the study. We want to advertise to Increase user acceptance and safety outlook on AV taxi rides.
* What is a quantifiable metric  (e.g. reduce the fraction of users with 4-week inactivity)
	* We want to increase the number of people in the Pittsburgh area who would consider themselves comfortable and safe to use the AV taxi ride service. (We would consider comfortable to be a 3 or higher on a scale of 1-5, and safe to be a 3 or higher on a scale of 1-5)
* Quantify what improvement in the values of the metrics are useful for the customer scenario
	* We want to increase amount of persons who feel comfortable and safe sharing the road with AV’s by 10%.
* What is the baseline (current) value of the metric?
	* Current road users who feel comfortable and safe sharing the road with AV’s is 73% of surveyed users based on the study in 2017. In 2019, 83% of surveyed users feel comfortable and safe sharing the road with AV’s.
* How will we measure the metric?
	* After promotion of app, we will re-survey the population in 4 weeks time to measure their comfortability and safety levels.
