Data loading: The dataset is loaded into memory from the data directory.
Data cleaning: Any missing values or outliers are handled, and necessary data transformations are performed.
Data exploration: Various statistical measures, visualizations, and descriptive analysis techniques are applied to understand the dataset's characteristics.
Insights and findings: Key findings and insights from the analysis are summarized and presented.
Usage

Results
