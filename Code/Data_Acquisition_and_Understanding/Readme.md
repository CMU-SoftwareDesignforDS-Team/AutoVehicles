## Exploratory Data Analysis
The purpose of this project is to perform an initial exploration of the given dataset and gain insights into its structure, patterns, and potential relationships between variables. <br>

### Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is located in the Data directory. It consists of Survey Responses 2019, Member Responses 2017 and Public Responses 2017. <br>

### Code
The code for the EDA is written in Python. The main script for the analysis is EDA.ipynb, located in the Code directory. This script performs the following steps: 

- Data loading: The dataset is loaded into memory from the data directory. <br>
- Data cleaning: Any missing values or outliers are handled, and necessary data transformations are performed. <br>
- Data exploration: Various statistical measures, visualizations, and descriptive analysis techniques are applied to understand the dataset's characteristics. <br>
- Insights and findings: Key findings and insights from the analysis are summarized and presented. <br>


### Results
The findings from the exploratory data analysis are documented in the https://github.com/CMU-SoftwareDesignforDS-Team/AutoVehicles/tree/main/Docs/Data_Report. This report includes detailed analysis, visualizations, and insights gained from the dataset. <br>
