This is the project repository for Team Diverse Data Dynamics, a group participating in the CMU course "Software Design for Data Scientists." Our team specializes in utilizing data science techniques to address marketing challenges.

In this project, we leveraged publicly available datasets from DATA.GOV to assist our potential client in launching an Auto Taxi marketing campaign. By analyzing and extracting insights from these datasets, we aimed to provide valuable information and strategies to support our client's marketing efforts.
